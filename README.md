# Prediction of Hypoxia in Breast Cancer Indicator Cell Lines

This is my first group project in university which is done for AILAB class. We were given some biological background to do this project which is mainly based on RNA sequencing and cell structure. I could not provide the dataset files as I do not have rights to do and they belongs to the Prof. Francesca Buffa and her research team. First of all there are 2 breast cancer indicator cell lines, mcf7 and hcc1806, the experiments that we have done are the same for the each cell, and there are 2 techniques of analysing these two cell lines which are dropseq and smartseq. We also compared these 2 techniques showing which one leads the greater result. The datasets contains samples of cells belongs to people either have breast cancer or not, namely if hypoxia exists, the person has cancer. The features on the dataset are the count of each cell with spesific position. The entire project consist of exploratory data analysis, unsupervised learning and comparing supervised learning algorithms comparison. At the end, our parameters did give at least %96. accuracy for the diagnosis of cancer in any cell line or the technique.
